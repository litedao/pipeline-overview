The design mimics the mechanics of the actual Dai Stablecoin System, which means we will be able to learn many lessons about the operation and implementation tradeoffs associated with an actual stablecoin in the wild. The main difference between Sai and the Dai Stablecoin System is the fact that Sai completely trusts the authorized price feed provider (detailed in the Oracle MVP task), allowing for a much simpler design. We are going to start with a slow rollout, but we intend to open Sai up to the community and make it easy for anyone to benefit from its stability.",

Large bundles of tokens are always being added to the pool, and bidders can choose to isolate a smaller lot size by bidding and creating a new sub-auction. This creates many small auctions from one large lot, aiding price discovery and liquidity. This token auction will be used to auction off collateral tokens in the flip auction, MKR in the flop auction, and Dai in the flap auction.",

Like Sai's cage system, this process will include a way for CDP's to be wound down in an orderly fashion and a way for Dai holders to redeem their stablecoins in exchange for collateral. This work item will allow us to launch the Dai Stablecoin System before having mathematically proven its correctness. The cage function will be engaged by administrators if a serious error is discovered, or during an upgrade process from one system to the next, such as when a formally verified system is completed.",
